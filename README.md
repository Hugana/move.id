### Introduction
Final project of Informatics and Multimedia Engineering Bsc.​

The project titled "move.id - Outlier Detection in Human Activity Data" aims to leverage data from bands (in our case we used a phone) that are in patients that have risk of falling.

By accquiring this data from theese sensors, the project seeks to build representative datasets of both standard and non-standard movements. Utilizing these datasets, the project will create classifiers capable of detecting outlier movements. 
When such out-of-the-ordinary movements are identified by these classifiers, notifications will be sent to predefined users such as healthcare teams, via phone application, to alert them of anomalies in the patients movement.

This system indends to enchance patient monitoring and provide timely alerts for potential issues detected through the analysis of sensor data.
